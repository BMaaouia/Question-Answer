# Question/Answer Dataset Analysis

## Description

This project focuses on selecting a Question/Answer dataset and performing both pre-processing and modeling tasks within a single structured notebook. The goal is to apply various natural language processing (NLP) techniques for data preparation and compare different deep learning models for question-answering tasks.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Data Pre-processing

Applying NLP techniques on the selected dataset, including:

  -Tokenization: Splitting text into words or subwords.
  
  -Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms.
  
  -Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words that do not add meaning.
  
  -Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Identifying grammatical categories.
  
  -Other Cleaning Steps: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.

### 2. Modeling

Training and evaluating different models:

  -Bi-RNN (Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network)
  
  -Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)
  
  -Transformer-based Model (e.g., BERT, T5, or GPT variant)

The models will be compared based on:

  -Accuracy
  
  -Loss
  
  -Performance on unseen data

## Tech Stack

-Programming Language: Python

-Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers

-Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
